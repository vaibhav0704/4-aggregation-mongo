## Project Made using Node.js

## Run Project in Dev Mode?

```bash
$ docker compouse up
```

## Approach

Here is my understanding of the MongoDB's aggregation framework. This frameworks helps in data analytics. Using this framework we can create multiple sets of pipelines where we can process data for lets say research analysis, performace analysis etc.

once you run this application, it creates a dummy data of size 200. Then performs aggregation operations on it. You can view application generated logs to view the results.
